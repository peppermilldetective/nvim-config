# NeoVim Configuration!

A custom configuration for NeoVim that fulfills what I need and want out of NeoVim (for the moment).

Utilizes `lazy.nvim` as the package manager. Primary completion engine is `blink.nvim` as `nvim-cmp` can be slow and outdated. `mason` and `lspconfig` are used for handling LSP configuration.
